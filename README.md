# final-project
The purpose of the project is to provide a randomized recommendation to the user.
To run the program if on a windows computer input "python recommendator.py Artist.csv",
and if on a Mac input "python3 recommendator.py Artist.csv". The user will be 
prompted with a list of possible genres to choose from, and will be asked to 
input a genre of music they want to see (ex. "pop"). Following that input, the 
user will be asked to input the type of music they want, whether it is a song, 
artist, or album. The program will then take that information and run through the 
functions to output a random recommendation from the csv file. An example is if 
the user wants a pop song, the output will say "Your recommended song is: (random)".
To create the program, the only outside source that was used was Kaggle in order
to get a csv file that could be applied to the program.
